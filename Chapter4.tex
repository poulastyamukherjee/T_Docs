\section{Multi-Robot Approach for Weld Cost Minimization}

In the approach section(cite section) we discussed how introduction of another robot can increase the number of degrees of freedom and hence allow the robot to perform more complex manipulations. Increasing the degree of complexity of motion can allow us to implement better optimization as well as solve the problems of unreachability and singularity. In this chapter we will discuss the integration of a 2 degrees of freedom rotary table into the existing architecture and how that is utilized to optimize the welding task. 

\subsection{Modeling the Rotary Table}
The existing implementation only contained kinematic description of the 6 axis manipulator with the weld tool tip. In the following subsections, we present a model of the 2 degree of freedom rotary table, along with the kinematic description and present the improved architectural model.
\subsubsection{Architecture of RobotKit}
The following architectural diagram(\ref{fig:img9}) has been color coded for better understanding. Blue represents the core functionalities of RobotKit. Red represents the kinematics and visualization models on which the improvements are implemented. Green represents external configuration files that are loaded inside RobotKit. Yellow represents the OMPL based planning library and pink represents the user interface block. \\
In the existing architecture the Kernel block creates instances of the kinematics and visualization models of the 6 Dof robot, which update the simulation environment based on the data input from the Information Exchange Pipeline. The planner interface class takes input from the kernel and the information exchange pipeline and user input for welding task. It then creates a planning problem and sends it to the OMPL based planning library. The communication between the planner interface and the planning library takes place using dll files. The project configuration file loads information about the dH parameters of the robot, position of the work piece and other relevant objects and in the weld cell.

In the following architecture diagram (\ref{fig:img10}) the exact blocks which have been updated are highlighted. The kinematic and the visualization models now also includes definition of rotary table. The project configuration file (highlighted in green) has also been updated to include the dH parameters of the rotary table.

\subsubsection{Generating 3D Models for Simulation}
In order to update the simulation environment, 3D CAD models of the rotary table were created using Solidworks software(cite solidworks), based on the data-sheet specifications. In order to make the simulation mimic the real functioning of the rotary table, the table was divided into 3 separate CAD objects; base, middle joint and top plate. The images for the same are presented herewith.

\end{figure}
 

\subsubsection{Kinematic Description of the Rotary Table}

The kinematic description of the 2 Dof Rotary table was created using the standard DH parameter approach. The DH parameters as specified in the Reis welding cell data-sheet(cite datasheet) are presented in the following table \ref{tab2}
\begin{table}[!htbp]
\centering
\scalebox{1.2}{%
\frame{\begin{tabular}{@{}lllll@{}}
\toprule
i & $\alpha_{i-1}$ & a\_\{i-1\} & d\_\{i\} & $\theta_{i}$ \\ \midrule
1 & 0              & 0          & 0        & $\theta_{1}$ \\
2 & -90            & 0          & 150 mm     & $\theta_{2}$
\end{tabular}%
}}
\caption{DH parameter of Rotary Table}
\label{tab2}
\end{table}
\\
The next step is to construct the link frames of the joints of the table in accordance with the approach mentioned in (cite Introduction to robotics, jacob book). The frames were plotted in Cartesian space with actual values from the real robot system. The values are the actual coordinates of the joint with respect to the global coordinate frame. Since the rotary table present in the welding cell has 2 Dof, we take Joint 0 as a reference frame, which coincides with the frame of Joint 1. According to the Reis welding cell data-sheet(use cite doc), the axis of rotation of Joint 1 of the rotary table is same as the X axis of the robot frame of the 6 dof manipulator and the axis of rotation of Joint 2 is same as the Z axis of the robot frame of the 6 dof manipulator. \\
In the following figure \ref{fig:img12} the world and robot frames along with the joint frames of the rotary table in the Cartesian coordinate frame are plotted. 
\begin{figure}[!htbp] %  figure placement: here, top, bottom, or page
 \centering
   \frame{\includegraphics[width=12cm]{images/Frames_jnttab.png}}
   \caption{Link Frame Relationship of Joints of Rotary Table}  
\label{fig:img12}
\end{figure}

Based on the DH parameters from table \ref{tab2} we now construct the forward kinematic chain. 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq20}
_{0}^{1}\textrm{T} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta_{i} & -\sin \theta_{i} & 0 & 0\\ \sin \theta_{i} & \cos \theta_{i} & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq21}
_{2}^{1}\textrm{T} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta_{i} & -\sin \theta_{i} & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 150\\ -\sin \theta_{i} & -\cos\theta_{i} & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq22}
\textrm{T}_{table} =_{2}^{0}\textrm{T}_{1}^{0}\textrm{T}._{2}^{1}\textrm{T} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos^{2}\theta_{i}& -\cos\theta_{i}.\sin\theta_{i} & -\sin\theta_{i} & -150*\sin\theta_{i}\\ \cos\theta_{i}.\sin\theta_{i} & -\sin^{2}\theta_{i} & \cos\theta_{i} & 150*\cos\theta_{i}\\ -\sin\theta_{i} & -\cos\theta_{i}& 0 & 0\\ 0& 0& 0& 1\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Workpiece Transformation}

Since the main objective of moving the rotary table is to move the work piece, a transformation function is also necessary to simulate the changed position of the work piece in accordance with the motion of the table.

\subsection{Cost Function Formulation}
Two different cost functions were formulated and finally a weighted combination of the two was created, to form the final cost function. The plots of the cost functions were created by running the planner for every different orientations of the table for the following two work pieces. For each workpiece 2 edges were randomly selected to demonstrate the behaviors based on the cost function definition. The edges also contain the convention definition, which specifies the alignment of the TCP with respect to the selected edge. For example in \ref{fig:imgoridef1} and \ref{fig:imgoridef2}, the TCP moves along the planned path in accordance with the convention; the X axis (marked by red) points from start to goal point along the edge to be welded, and the Y (marked by green) and Z (marked by blue) maintain an angle of 45$^{\circ}$ with respect to the selected edge. \\

\subsubsection{Difference of TCP orientation and Workpiece edge}
In (\ref{fig:tcor}) we saw the relationship between TCP orientation and the workpiece convention. In order to generate high quality weld paths, it is necessary to orient the TCP in accordance with the optimal TCP orientation definition. Therefore for our first cost function definition; we consider the difference between the actual TCP orientation and the optimal welding process defined TCP orientation (cite ppr). The greater the difference, higher the cost and vice-versa. The difference of the quaternions is calculated using the following steps as defined in (cite ppr).
\begin{itemize}
	%content...
	\item Both the sets of quaternions are defined using the standard convention og 4 quaternion components namely: $q1,q2,q3,q4$
	\item Calculate the normal of optimal and actual quaternion values.
	\item Calculate the inverse of the normalized optimal quaternion and multiply with the normalized actual quaternion to obtain the difference of the quaternions.
	\item Convert the difference of the quaternions into an angle value.
	\item Ensure difference angle lies within -180$^{\circ}$ and 180$^{\circ}$
\end{itemize}
In order to analyze the cost function, it was necessary to plot the cost values generated for each welding path for various orientation of the table. We considered a range of -80$^{\circ}$ to +80$^{\circ}$ for 1st joint angle and -140$^{\circ}$ to 140$^{\circ}$ for 2nd joint angle of the table. Plots for both use cases; as illustrated in figures \ref{fig:uc1} and \ref{fig:uc2}
were generated.

The edge to be welded is marked in yellow \ref{fig:cp1b}. In this cost plot \ref{fig:cp1a}, the minimum cost is obtained when both the joint angles of the table are at 0$^{\circ}$. In the plot, red represents a higher cost region while blue represents lower cost.

\subsubsection{Cost Function based on Joint Movement}
An important criteria of optimizing industrial processes is minimizing the joint movements of a manipulator(cite relevant paper). According to the paper, the more the movement of the bigger joints, the less accurate the process becomes as a small error in the first three joints can propagate to the TCP all the while amplifying its effect, resulting in a gross error.(chng) The following cost function, is defined as follows (write equation.)
