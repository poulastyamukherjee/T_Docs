\section{Summery}
In this work we proposed a conceptual architecture for using semantic information
to improve path planning aspect of navigation for large and dynamic human made environments. 
The architecture consists of two parts: an \textit{Environment model} and a \textit{Navigation Planning System}.
Our \textit{Environment model} stores metric, topological and semantic information by using a multi-hierarchical representation.
One hierarchy (S-Box) represents symbols of entities in the environment along with their spatial information
The other hierarchy (T-Box) represents semantic information about the environment in the form of concepts and relations.
In our S-Box we also used the concept of semantic positions which are abstract navigation points for a region.\\

The information stored in the \textit{Environment Model} is exploited by the \textit{Navigation Planner System} to construct an abstract navigation plan at a semantic level to satisfy the given goal.
This semantic plan is then used for generating a detailed geometric plan. 
Using semantics along with spatial information helps to improve the navigation planning by making it robust and flexible. It also facilitates better human robot communication.

We considered two different environmental setups for a service robot: 
\begin{itemize}
 \item A University building for a Library Assistant Robot
 \item A home environment for a Home Assistant Robot
\end{itemize}
These setups pose different challenges for a service and we analyzed some of them with respect to navigation path planning.
Base on this analysis we developed our architecture for navigation planning.
To validate our work, we consider a case study of a service robot working in a home environment setup.

This work is a stepping stone towards the goal of having an architecture which exploits semantic and other spatial information for a motion planner
