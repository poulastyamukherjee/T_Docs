Traditional approach to coverage planning has always focused on developing new techniques for area decomposition and applying search based techniques to navigate an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) through the decomposed areas. A key feature ignored in these approaches is the nature of the motion followed by the UAV. Usually the actual motion path of an UAV, using these traditional techniques, is characterized by sharp turns and quite a few start-stop motions. This results in higher time requirement for completing coverage and depletion of excess battery power (as more work needs to be  done to move the UAV). Considering the fact that UAVs have limited computational capability and power supply, these two factors are equally important as the percentage of area covered.\\
In this work we propose algorithms based on geometric functions which have smoother trajectory compared to the lawnmower approach. By conducting experiments using our proposed methods, we were able to prove that algorithms with smoother trajectories take 22.22\%  lesser time and consume 30\% lesser energy compared to lawnmower approach - while achieving atleast 98\% coverage.
