\section{Implementation in Real Robot}
In this section, we present some images captured while implementing our algorithm on the Reis Welding Cell. The workpiece was positioned at coordinates (1185,520,600) with respect to the world frame. After executing the optimization algorithm, the optimal table position was found to be at Joint1 = $5^{\circ}$ and Joint2 = $-15^{\circ}$.
